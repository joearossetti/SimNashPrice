Title: Simulate Bertrand Nash Prices
Version: 0.0.2.000
Author: Joseph Rossetti
Maintainer: Joseph Rossetti <rossetti.28@osu.edu>
Description: This pacakge takes as input results from a BLP style demand
    estimation. It will compute the Bertrand Nash Prices, the resulting
    market shares, and profits.  This functionality can be used to evaluate counterfactuals. It can also compute welfare measures and marginal costs based on demand estimates. It also has a simulation routine for drawing from
    the structural errors and computing ex-ante expectations of shares, prices, and
    profits.
